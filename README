Getargs::Mixed
==============

This is a handy little module to help you handle mixed argument lists passed
to subroutines. This can handle positional, named, and mixed positional/named
argument lists passed to subroutines. This is done by providing a simple
specification that can also handle object-oriented, procedural or mixed
object-oriented/procedural situations and returns the passed arguments as
a hash.

See the POD docs at https://metacpan.org/pod/Getargs::Mixed for details.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Or, if you have App::cpanminus installed, "cpanm Getargs::Mixed".

DEPENDENCIES

Doesn't have any if you have a typical Perl 5.8.0 or higher distribution
installed. It may work on earlier versions of Perl, but the Makefile.PL
and module will have to be modified since I haven't attempted to test this
theory.
